# ðŸŒ¿ Flora Care Application

## âœ… 1. Introduction
Flora Care is a Spring Boot application designed for plant nurseries or gardening enthusiasts to manage their plants and log care activities like watering, fertilizing, pruning, etc. It helps maintain plant health by ensuring consistent care routines.

## ðŸŽ¯ 2. Objective / Problem Statement
Often in plant nurseries or homes, thereâ€™s no reliable system to track when a plant was last watered or fertilized. This can lead to overwatering, missed fertilization, or poor plant health. The goal of Flora Care is to provide a digital record for each plant and its care routine, improving maintenance and plant longevity.

## ðŸŒ± 4. Core Functionalities

### ðŸŒ¼ Plant Management
- Add new plants with details like name, species, price, and grow environment (indoor/outdoor/both).
